---

The easiest way to take a screenshot on a Mac is to use the keyboard shortcuts.

* To take a screenshot of the entire screen, use option-command-3 (⌥-⌘-3)
* To take a screenshot of part of the screen, use option-command-4 (⌥-⌘-4). The mouse cursor will change to a crosshairs, which you can drag to select a rectangle you would like to capture.
