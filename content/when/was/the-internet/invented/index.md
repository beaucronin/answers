title: When was the internet invented?
---

The internet is a combination of multiple technologies, which were developed over decades at US universities and government research labs. Arguably the most central of these to the internet, the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) were published in 1974. The first demonstration connecting multiple networks took place in 1977.
