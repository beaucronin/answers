Clouds are categorized by their height in the atmosphere.

  * **Cirrus** clouds are made of ice crystals and look like long, thin, wispy white streamers high in the sky.
  * **Cirrocumulus** clouds are small rounded puffs that usually appear in long rows high in the sky.
  * **Cirrostratus** clouds are high, thin sheet-like thin clouds that usually cover the entire sky.
* Medium
  * **Altocumulus** clouds are mid-level, grayish-white with one part darker than the other. 
  * **Altostratus** clouds are mid-level, gray or blue-gray clouds that usually cover the whole sky.
* Low
  * **Stratus** clouds are low and have a uniform gray in color and can cover most or all of the sky.
  * **Stratocumulus** clouds are low, lumpy, and gray, either lined up in rows or spread out.
  * **Nimbostratus** clouds are dark gray, have ragged bases and sit low in the sky.
* Vertical
  * **Cumulus** clouds have vertical growth. They are puffy white or light gray clouds that look like floating cotton balls.
