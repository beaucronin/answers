title: What are the kinds of diabetes?
---

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas cannot make insulin, or the body is unable to properly use insulin. There are three kinds of diabetes:

* In **Type 1 diabetes**, the body produces very little insulin and daily insulin shots are required.
* In **Type 2 diabetes**, the body does not make good use of the insulin it produces. Healthy lifestyle can control this kind of diabetes, although insulin may also be needed.
* In **Gestational diabetes**, high blood glucose occurs during pregnancy, affecting both the mother and the child.
