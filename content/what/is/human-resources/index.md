title: What is human resources?
---

Human resources (HR) is a department or function within a company that is responsible for "hiring and firing" employees. The hiring function includes recruiting, salary and job negotiation. After employees are hired, HR is responsible for monitoring and enforcing codes of behavior, both those specific to the company and those required for compliance to regulation. When an employee will be terminated, either with or without cause, and as an individual or as part of a group, HR is typically the department most involved in the process.

## Context

* In recent years, it has been observed that Human Resources, as traditionally defined above, is subject to strong conflicts. Especially in knowledge-based workplaces where employees are skilled and have individual bargaining power, it has become problematic to have a single department responsible for both attracting and retaining employees, and then also disciplining and terminating them.
