title: What is a Smart TV?
---

A Smart TV is a television that includes hardware and software that enable it to connect to the internet and run applications that obtain and display content, rather than requiring a separate "set top box" or other interface to deliver content. In addition, Smart TVs may be able to run other applications, and therefore function as a general-purpose home computer.
