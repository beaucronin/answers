title: What is a server?
---

A server is a computer, connected to a network, that other computers connect to in order to perform tasks, access data, or otherwise obtain capabilities that they cannot do themselves. A server is typically located in a different place from the computer that is accessing it: in another room, in a dedicated facility, or even in an unknown location ("in the cloud").
