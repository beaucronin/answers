title: What is a sociopath?
---

A sociopath is a person who does not have empathy for other people, and who is not concerned about how others view them. Sociopaths do not take pleasure in causing harm or pain to others per se, although their lack of regard for others' feelings does lead many sociopaths to engage in behavior that is rewarding or gratifying, but that does injure others. Typical signs include lying, law-breaking, and unsafe behaviors.
