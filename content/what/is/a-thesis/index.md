title: What is a thesis (statement)?
---

A thesis statement is an important, early element of an essay that clearly communicates the main point or claim that will be made in the essay. It is often, though not always, placed at the end of the first paragraph. The main body of the essay is then dedicated to presenting and discussing examples and evidence in support of the thesis. A good thesis statement is clear, concise, and easy to tell apart from alternative theses.
