title: What is fracking?

Fracking is short for "hydraulic fracturing". It is a form of natural gas extraction in which large amounts of fluid are injected underground, into rock that contains natural gas. The pressure from the fluid creates small fractures that allow the gas to release and be reclaimed on the surface.
