title: What does poison ivy look like?
---

Poison ivy has "compound" leaves, meaning that each leaf is composed of three leaflets. The middle leaflet has a longer stem than the two side leaflets. The stem on the side leaflets can be so small as to be almost invisible, and they are always directly across from each other.

Poison ivy turns yellow or red in the fall. Young vines are smooth, and older vines are hairy.
